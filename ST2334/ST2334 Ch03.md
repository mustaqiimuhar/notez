#ST2334 Ch03 - Descriptive Statistics

## Categorical Variables
### Pie charts
> * Area (and angle) of each slice of pie corresponds to the percentage for each outcome.
> * Full pie represents 100% of the observations
> * Bad way to display information because the eye is not good at judging relative areas. Better at judging linear measures, so bar charts and pareto charts are preferred.

### Bar charts
> * Length of each bar indicates frequency
> * Fixed width
> * Horizontal or Vertical
> * If we want to draw attention to the relative proportion of objects falling into each category, we could replace the counts with percentages and use a relative frequency bar chart.

### Pareto charts
> * Vertical bar chart plotted in descending order
> * Cumulative line graph on the same diagram
> * Can use different aces for bar and line graph (label carefully)
> * Using common axes allow for both count and percentage to be displayed
> * Quickly identifies major components and their cumulative share.

## Numerical Variables
### Histograms
> * Split the range of data into intervals called `bins`
> * Count the number of observations in each bin
> * Plot either the `counts` or `relative frequencies` for the bins.

### Stem-and-leaf plots
> * A stem-and-leaf plot contains 2 columns separated by a vertical line
> * The left column contains the stems and the right column, the leaves.
> * Stem-and-leaf displays are especially useful when you make them by hand for batches of fewer than a few hundred data values.
> * They are a quick way to display, end even to record, numbers.

### Dot-plots
> * A dot chart/ dot plot is a chart where data points are plotted on a simple scale.
> * A dot for each observation.
> * Visual summary of information when data is not too large
> * May not be able to identify pattern when data is small.
> * Useful to find unusual features.

## Measures of Location
> Statistics that consider where the data are centered. For example: Mean, Median, Percentiles

### Mean
> * Average of the observations
> 	* The mean is oversensitive to extreme values; it may not be representative of the location of the majority of sample points.

### Median
> * Midpoint of the observations
> * To determine the median
> 	1. Put the *n* observations in order of their size
> 	2. When *n* is odd, the median is the middle observation in the ordered sample.
> 	3. When *n* is even, two observations from the ordered sample fall in the middle, the median is their average.
> * Advantages:
> 	* Insensitive to very large or very small values.
> * Limitations:
> 	* It is determined mainly by the middle points in a sample and is less sensitive to the actual numeric values of the remaining data points.

### Mode
> * The value that occurs most often in the dataset.
> * May have more than one mode in the dataset
> 	* Unimodal (1 mode)
> 	* Bimodal (2 modes)
> 	* Trimodal (3 modes)
 
## Measures of Scale or Spread
### Range
> * The difference between the largest and the smallest observations.
> * Easy to compute but ignores all information between the largest and smallest values.
> * Advantages:
> 	* Very easy to compute once the sample points are ordered.
> * Limitations:
> 	* Very sensitive to extreme observations.
> 	* Depends on the sample size *n*. The larger the sample size, the larger the range tends to be. This makes it difficult to compare ranges between datasets of different sizes.

### Quantiles & Percentiles
> * The *p* th percentile is a value such that *p* percent of the observations fall below or at that value. 
> * The 50th percentile is usually == the median.
> * 3 useful percentiles known as `quartiles`
> 	* The first quartile has *p* = 25
> 	* The second quartile has *p* = 50
> 	* The third quartile has *p* = 75

### Sample Variance

> * Computational Formula
>![alt text][computational-sample-variance]
[computational-sample-variance]:./images/computational-sample-variance.png "computational sample variance"

> * The sample variance is not really the variance of the sample. It is just a tool to estimate the population variance.
> * It is the mean square distance to the population mean. But we do not usually have the population mean, so we plug in the sample mean instead. In most circumstance, by doing this plug in, we end up slightly underestimating. So the "n-1" corrects for it.

### Standard Deviation

[standard-deviation-2]:./images/standard-deviation-2.png "Standard Deviation 2"

### Interquartile Range (IQR)
> * The distance between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1)
> * IQR = Q3 - Q1

### Coefficient of Variation
> * Relative mesaure of variation
> * Definition: 
> 	* `The coefficient of variation CV is defined to be standard deviation as a fraction/percentage of mean (in absolute value)`
> ![alt text][coefficient-of-variation]

### Boxplots
> * A box plot or box-and-whisker plot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their five-number summaries:
> 	* The sample minimum
> 	* First Quartile (Q1)
> 	* Median (Q2)
> 	* Third Quartile (Q2)
> 	* The sample maximum

## Shape of a Distribution
> * Look at the overall pattern and look out for
> 	* Clusters
> 	* Gaps
> 	* Deviations
> 	* Mounds
> 		* Single mound - Unimodal
> 		* 2 Mounds - Bimodal
> * Describing the shape of a distribution
> 	* Symmetric
> 	* Skewed
> ![alt text][shape-of-distribution]
[shape-of-distribution]:./images/shape-of-distribution.png "Shape of Distribution"
> * Comparing the Mean and Median
> 	* Symmetric
> 		* Relative position of the points on each side of the sample median is the same.
> 	* Can use the relationship between the mean and median to assess the symmetry of a distribution.
