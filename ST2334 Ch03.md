#ST2334 Ch03 - Descriptive Statistics

## Categorical Variables
### Pie charts
> * Area (and angle) of each slice of pie corresponds to the percentage for each outcome.
> * Full pie represents 100% of the observations
> * Bad way to display information because the eye is not good at judging relative areas. Better at judging linear measures, so bar charts and pareto charts are preferred.

### Bar charts
> * Length of each bar indicates frequency
> * Fixed width
> * Horizontal or Vertical
> * If we want to draw attention to the relative proportion of objects falling into each category, we could replace the counts with percentages and use a relative frequency bar chart.

### Pareto charts
> * Vertical bar chart plotted in descending order
> * Cumulative line graph on the same diagram
> * Can use different aces for bar and line graph (label carefully)
> * Using common axes allow for both count and percentage to be displayed
> * Quickly identifies major components and their cumulative share.

## Numerical Variables
### Histograms
> * Split the range of data into intervals called `bins`
> * Count the number of observations in each bin
> * Plot either the `counts` or `relative frequencies` for the bins.

### Stem-and-leaf plots
> * A stem-and-leaf plot contains 2 columns separated by a vertical line
> * The left column contains the stems and the right column, the leaves.
> * Stem-and-leaf displays are especially useful when you make them by hand for batches of fewer than a few hundred data values.
> * They are a quick way to display, end even to record, numbers.

### Dot-plots
> * A dot chart/ dot plot is a chart where data points are plotted on a simple scale.
> * A dot for each observation.
> * Visual summary of information when data is not too large
> * May not be able to identify pattern when data is small.
> * Useful to find unusual features.

## Measures of Location
> Statistics that consider where the data are centered. For example: Mean, Median, Percentiles

### Mean
> * Average of the observations
> 	* The mean is oversensitive to extreme values; it may not be representative of the location of the majority of sample points.

### Median
> * Midpoint of the observations
> * To determine the median
> 	1. Put the *n* observations in order of their size
> 	2. When *n* is odd, the median is the middle observation in the ordered sample.
> 	3. When *n* is even, two observations from the ordered sample fall in the middle, the median is their average.
> * Advantages:
> 	* Insensitive to very large or very small values.
> * Limitations:
> 	* It is determined mainly by the middle points in a sample and is less sensitive to the actual numeric values of the remaining data points.

### Mode
> * The value that occurs most often in the dataset.
> * May have more than one mode in the dataset
> 	* Unimodal (1 mode)
> 	* Bimodal (2 modes)
> 	* Trimodal (3 modes)
 
## Measures of Scale or Spread
### Range
> * The difference between the largest and the smallest observations.
> * Easy to compute but ignores all information between the largest and smallest values.
> * Advantages:
> 	* Very easy to compute once the sample points are ordered.
> * Limitations:
> 	* Very sensitive to extreme observations.
> 	* Depends on the sample size *n*. The larger the sample size, the larger the range tends to be. This makes it difficult to compare ranges between datasets of different sizes.

### Quantiles & Percentiles
> * The *p* th percentile is a value such that *p* percent of the observations fall below or at that value. 
> * The 50th percentile is usually == the median.
> * 3 useful percentiles known as `quartiles`
> 	* The first quartile has *p* = 25
> 	* The second quartile has *p* = 50
> 	* The third quartile has *p* = 75
