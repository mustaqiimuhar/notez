## Definitions
### Raw Data
> Data that has not been processed in any way

### Variable
> A characteristic that is different from one individual to another.

### Observational Unit
> An indivdual - an `observation`

### Sample Size
> Total number of observational units
> Typically represented by the letter `n`

### Dataset
> Complete set of raw data that comes from a survey or experiment.

## Types of Variables
### Categorical
> Consist of a group or category names that don't necessarily have any logical ordering.
> E.g.

> * Race
> * Gender
> * Hair color
> * Major
> * Favourite Avengers Character 

#### Ordinal
> May be used when a categorical variable has ordered categories. E.g. you can rate your driving skills using the codes 1 = better than average, 2 = average and 3 = worse than average.

> * Highest educational qualification
> * T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL).

### Numerical
#### Discrete
> Recorded as numerical values which are either measurements or counts taken on each individual. E.g. years of education, number of classes missed this week.

> * Pairs of shoes owned, number of friends on Facebook.

#### Continuous
> Every value within some interval is a possible result. E.g. height is a continuous quantitative variable because any height within some range is possible.

> * Weight, temperature, distance from home to NUS

## Experiments
### Treatment vs Control
#### Polio experiment
##### Control Group (controls)
> * Historical controls - Bad idea because results from different years may be different due to change in other underlying conditions.
> * Contemporaneous Controls
> 	* Compare between children with parent's consent against no-consent group (control).

> 		Bad Idea because
>		* Higher income parents are more likely to consent
>		* Children from higher income family more likely to get polio (strange, but true).

##### Confounder
> When 2 groups differ with respect to some factor other than treatment **and** the factor affects the treatment, we say the effect is confounded with the treatment.

> In this case, income is a confounder.

#### Good practices
##### Randomized Controls
> * Treatment and control groups are randomly assigned.

##### Double blind
> * Placebo effect - Patients need to be blind to whether they receive treatment or not.
> * Investigators should be blind too
> 	* Polio is hard to diagnose; diagnosis could be affected (perhaps subconsciously) by knowing if patient is vaccinated.
