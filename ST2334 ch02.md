## Definitions
### Raw Data
> Data that has not been processed in any way

### Variable
> A characteristic that is different from one individual to another.

### Observational Unit
> An indivdual - an `observation`

### Sample Size
> Total number of observational units
> Typically represented by the letter `n`

### Dataset
> Complete set of raw data that comes from a survey or experiment.

## Types of Variables
### Categorical
> Consist of a group or category names that don't necessarily have any logical ordering.
> E.g.

> * Race
> * Gender
> * Hair color
> * Major
> * Favourite Avengers Character 

#### Ordinal
> May be used when a categorical variable has ordered categories. E.g. you can rate your driving skills using the codes 1 = better than average, 2 = average and 3 = worse than average.

> * Highest educational qualification
> * T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL).

### Numerical
#### Discrete
> Recorded as numerical values which are either measurements or counts taken on each individual. E.g. years of education, number of classes missed this week.

> * Pairs of shoes owned, number of friends on Facebook.

#### Continuous
> Every value within some interval is a possible result. E.g. height is a continuous quantitative variable because any height within some range is possible.

> * Weight, temperature, distance from home to NUS

## Experiments
### Treatment vs Control
#### Polio experiment
##### Control Group (controls)
> * Historical controls - Bad idea because results from different years may be different due to change in other underlying conditions.
> * Contemporaneous Controls
> 	* Compare between children with parent's consent against no-consent group (control).

> 		Bad Idea because
>		* Higher income parents are more likely to consent
>		* Children from higher income family more likely to get polio (strange, but true).

##### Confounder
> When 2 groups differ with respect to some factor other than treatment **and** the factor affects the treatment, we say the effect is confounded with the treatment.

> In this case, income is a confounder.

#### Good practices
##### Randomized Controls
> * Treatment and control groups are randomly assigned.

##### Double blind
> * Placebo effect - Patients need to be blind to whether they receive treatment or not.
> * Investigators should be blind too
> 	* Polio is hard to diagnose; diagnosis could be affected (perhaps subconsciously) by knowing if patient is vaccinated.

### Observational Study
#### Smoking study
> * Not possible to do an experiment to investigate if smoking causes cancer by asking people to smoke
> * Observe to see if smokers are more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers.
> * Conclude that there is a strong association between smoking and lung cancer
> * There is an association, but cannot determine causation.

## Samples
### Probability Samples
#### Simple Random
> * Draw each sample unit indepedently at random
> * Each unit has equal chance of being samples
> * Any subset of `k` individuals has the same chance of being samples as any other subset of `k` individuals. E.g. assign every NUS student a number 1,2,3,... Use a random number generator to pick subjects.
> * ***Gold standard*** but often costly to implement.

#### Systematic
> * Ordered list, random starting point, take every *k* th member afterwards.
> * E.g. Sort matric numbers, draw a random number from 1 to 10, take every 10th person after that.
> * Need to ensure that the ordered list does not have other patterns that may affect the outcome.

#### Cluster
> * Divide population into several subgroups. Each subgroup is representative of the population.
> * Randomly select clusters.
> * Include all units from selected clusters to form sample.
> * E.g. Dengue prevention inspection - inspect every flat in a few randomly selected HDB blocks.

#### Stratified
> * Divide units into mutually exclusive subgroups.
> * Subgroups should have common properties. E.g. Major
> * Use `simple random sampling` to choose observations from each subgroup to form sample.
> * Similar to quota sampling but makes use of `chance` instead of `judgment`
 
### Non-probability Samples
#### Quota
> * Split population into mutually exclusive groups and sample them proportionally
> * E.g. if 5% of NUS students are from SoC, then 5% of the sample should be SoC students.
> * Take note of other requirements such as
> 	* Pick all males?
> 	* Quota that?

#### Convenience
> * E.g. all students in a lecture theatre.

#### Judgment
> * Using human judgment to select an appropriate sample
> * E.g. Stand outside UTown during lunch break to sample
> 	* Looks random enough?
> 	* Looks good enough?
> 	* Experts may also unwittingly introduce bias.
